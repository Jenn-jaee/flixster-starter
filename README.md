### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the labs definitely laid the foundation I needed to build the core of this project. Topics like using props, lifting state, conditional rendering, and React hooks were all essential in helping me navigate the dynamic behaviors of this project. However, the sidebar navigation stretch feature was definitely more complex than what we directly covered. It pushed me to learn more about conditional rendering, component structure, and view toggling in React.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, I would‚Äôve implemented local storage or a persistent backend so users' favorite and watched movies don‚Äôt reset on refresh. I also would've loved to experiment with animations‚Äîfor example, smooth transitions between views, or slight scaling effects when hovering over movie tiles to make the interface feel more interactive and modern.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I was really happy with how the core functionality came together in the demo‚Äîespecially being able to embed trailers and switch between views using the sidebar. The modal pop-up also felt clean and polished. One thing I saw others do that I‚Äôd love to try next time is integrating a theme switcher (light/dark mode) and possibly using a component library to speed up UI development without starting from scratch every time.

### Open-source libraries used

- [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/)
- [YouTube API for trailers](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)
